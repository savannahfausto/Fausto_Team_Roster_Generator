# A Breakdown of Team Roster Generator



## Purpose of Week 10 Challenge: Object-Oriented Programming

The motivation in creating this project is to explore the  use of classes and subclasses as a way of creating objects with reusable and specific functionality. Also, this project builds on inquirer prompts and template literals and how each of these concepts can interact with classes.

In using all of these concepts, this project aims to be an easy to use application to quickly create a working Team Roster with specific information relevant to each employee.

This project taught me about how classes can be used for reusable and specific functionality. Furthermore, I was challenged by how everything connects to create a working application, but with importing and exporting functions and data it slowly started to make more sense.

## Installation

Steps required to install your project: 

In order to install this project please clone the github repository from my github profile https://github.com/savannahfausto and specifically from the Fausto_Team_Roster_Generator repository.

## Usage

Find below instructions and examples for project use. 

Once the application is cloned to your local machine, open a terminal and run node index.js to start the application. The user should then be taken through prompts asking specific questions for each employee. Once the user chooses "I'm done making my roster", then an index.html file will be generated in the dist folder where they will find their specific roster.
